#Requires -Version 7

.SYNOPSIS
  Hands in a solved chapter: checks it, commits it and pushes it to a branch.

.EXAMPLE
  ./scripts/solve-chapter.ps1 2 my-solutions
  ./scripts/solve-chapter.ps1 2 my-solutions -NoPush

.NOTES
  The bash twin is scripts/solve-chapter.sh. The learner's side of
  finish-chapter: what gets committed is your work on the chapter's exercises —
  modules/exercises/src/main/…/chNN* and nothing else — and it only gets
  committed once every spec of the chapter is green against exactly that tree.
  There is no tag: tags mark chapters written, not solved.
